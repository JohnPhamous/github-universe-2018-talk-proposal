# GitHub Universe 2018 CFP

[CFP](https://github.submittable.com/submit/110757/github-universe-2018-call-for-proposals)

> **Ends on June 1, 2018**

## Theme

> Code: Let’s talk about the nuts and bolts of software. Which programming languages and frameworks are you using to build the next release or solve a tough technical challenge? What development environment and tools are you using to get your ideas into code? How do data and machine learning influence what you're building?

## Tips

* Content should be crafted from the perspective of the developer at various levels and functions in their careers
* Clarify key takeaways and be specific about what the audience can expect to learn
* Check out talks from last year to get an idea of what we are looking for
* We cannot accept product or sales pitches

## Consideration Points

* What’s really interesting to me about this, and where I think you’ve got a great link into universe, is the fact it has a whole culture around it. There’s a niche community dedicated to excellence in this thing that by their own definition isn’t the most useful pursuit. That’s fascinating. There’s so much commentary there on building software together
* What is it that brings people together for that, that is absent in those “more vital” spaces
* If you can draw links to open source platforms from the ricing community then you’re going to be set for a really good talk to sell in a proposal

## Abstract/Points

* Since the desktop interface is one of the msot used tools in our day to day lives, customizing it to fit your personal workflow and style is important.
* I rice my systems because I want to enjoy the different options to customize. From coding to presentations, I can easily change up the environment to suit the event.
* Tools from the ricing community allow you to make design decisions for your system. If you prefer to use only your keyboard, you can make a rice that provides optimal usage for that. Think of the plethora of plugin/themes for text editors but now at the OS level.
